📊 Expense Analysis Project (Python & Pandas)
📌 Overview

This project demonstrates how to analyze real-world expense data using Python and Pandas.
It focuses on data loading, cleaning, and extracting meaningful insights from a CSV dataset that represents daily expenses.

The project follows a practical data analysis workflow, similar to what is expected in entry-level data analyst or Python roles.

🗂️ Dataset Description

The dataset (expenses.csv) contains the following columns:

Date – Date of the expense

Category – Type of expense (Food, Travel, Rent, Shopping, etc.)

Amount – Expense amount

Payment_Mode – Mode of payment (UPI, Cash, Card, NetBanking)

Notes – Short description of the expense

The dataset intentionally includes missing values and duplicate entries to simulate real-world data issues.
