Expense Analyzer using Python & Pandas

 📌 Project Overview
The **Expense Analyzer** is a beginner-friendly data analysis project built using **Python**, **Pandas**, and **Matplotlib**.  
The goal of this project is to analyze personal expense data, clean it, and extract meaningful insights through basic analysis and visualizations.

This project helped me understand the complete data analysis workflow, from raw data to insights.

🧾 Dataset Description
The dataset contains personal expense records with the following columns:
- **Date** – Date of the expense
- **Category** – Type of expense (Food, Rent, Shopping, etc.)
- **Amount** – Money spent
- **Payment_Mode** – Mode of payment (Cash, UPI, Card, etc.)

 🔄 Project Workflow

### 1️⃣ Data Loading
- Loaded expense data from a CSV file using Pandas.

 2️⃣ Data Cleaning
- Checked for missing values
- Filled missing expense amounts with 0
- Removed duplicate records

 3️⃣ Data Analysis
- Calculated:
  - Total expenses
  - Average expense
  - Maximum and minimum expense
- Analyzed expenses by:
  - Category
  - Payment mode

 4️⃣ Data Visualization
- Created bar charts to visualize:
  - Total expenses by category
  - Total expenses by payment mode

 5️⃣ Data Export
- Saved the cleaned and analyzed data into a new CSV file for future use.

 📊 Key Insights
- Rent contributes the highest portion of total expenses.
- Digital payment methods are used more frequently than cash.
- Expense distribution shows a mix of fixed and variable spending.
